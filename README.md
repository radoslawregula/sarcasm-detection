# Classification of sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines using convolutional neural networks

The notebook implements a solution to a natural language processing sarcasm detection problem using CNN. 
The code was based on existing research on the topic, specified in the notebook's introduction.

Keras with TensorFlow backend and scikit-learn were used, along with GloVe pre-trained word vectors to perform word embedding.
